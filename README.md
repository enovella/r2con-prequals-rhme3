### r2 the Rhme3!

The RHme (Riscure Hack me) is a low level hardware CTF that comes in the form of an Arduino board (AVR architecture). It involves a set of SW and HW challenges to test your skills in different areas such as side channel analysis, fault injection, reverse-engineering and software exploitation. In our talk we will briefly recap RHme2 and introduce the upcoming RHme3. This year we decided to create a special target called the Riscurino board which features CAN controllers for a real automotive hacking experience! During the r2con we challenge you to solve as many challenges as you can using radare2. Are you up to the task? By the time the r2con takes place the registration for RHme3 will be closed. However, we reserved 5 Riscurino boards for giving away during the conference. Be at r2con and win one of these boards by solving the qualification challenge(s) using radare2!
